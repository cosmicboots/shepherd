# Shepherd

Shepherd is a git repository manager. This arises out of the personal need to
work with a collection of ever-changing git repositories, on more than one
machine.

The goal is to have a _single_ "repositories" file that can be synced
across devices. Shepherd would take this file, allow for syncing repository
configurations and bulk operations (fetch, unified log, etc).
